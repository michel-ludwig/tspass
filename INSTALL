Build Requirements
===================

First of all, you need CMake version 2.6 or above (http://www.cmake.org/) and working C, C++ compilers.
Additionally, the Flex and Bison lexer and parser generators are required.

Building & Installing
======================

# Create a build directory and change to it
$ mkdir build; cd build

# Create the Makefiles by invoking CMake
$ cmake <path-to-unpacked-tspass> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build 'tspass' and the 'fotl-translate' tool
$ make -j 3

# Finally, install everything
$ make install

You can now run 'tspass' with <path-to-installation-dir>/run-tspass.sh <input-file>!
